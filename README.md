# Server-side-Development-with-NodeJS-Express-and-MongoDB
It's some of my coding and training in here, and thanks to my dear teacher [Mr.Jogesh K. Muppala]

## Introduction to Server-side Development
+ In this module you will be introduced to Node, Node modules and the Node HTTP server. You will learn about the Express framework and how to set up a REST API using Express.

# Learning This Objectives

    Describe the use of Node for server-side development
    Create a Node application
    Demonstrate the use of Node modules in developing a Node application
    Develop a simple REST API server using the Express framework
    

## Data, Data, Where art Thou Data?
+ This module looks in detail at data storage with MongoDB, the popular NoSQL database. You will learn first about Express generator for scaffolding an Express application. Then you will learn about MongoDB. You will learn how to interact with MongoDB from a Node application. Then you will learn the Mongoose ODM to create schemas and models, and interact with MongoDB server.

# Learning Objectives

    Demonstrate an understanding of data persistence using a database
    Design persistent data storage based on MongoDB, a NoSQL database
    Develop schemas and models for data storage using Mongoose
    Combine the REST API and the data persistance layer for a full-fledged server implementation
    
    
## Halt! Who goes there?
+ This module is dedicated to user authentication. We first develop a full-fledged REST API server with Express, Mongo and Mongoose. Thereafter we examine basic authentication and session-based authentication briefly. We then develop token-based authentication with the support of JSON web tokens and the Passport module.

# Learning Objectives

    Demonstrate the need for user authentication
    Evaluate varioius alternative approaches for supporting user authentication
    Develop a comprehensive user authentication system using Passport
